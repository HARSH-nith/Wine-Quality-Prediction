# ![Red_Wine_Quality_Prediction (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75531664/123686693-ae2aaf80-d86d-11eb-968c-17c9b6629ce7.png)
#### In this project, I predict the quality of Wine :wine_glass: by using Machine Learning techniques.

## Requirements
* Numpy
* Python
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Sklearn
* Matplotlib

## Installation
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to install requirements.

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install seaborn
pip install sklearn
pip install matplotlib
```

## OverView
The code of this project is completely in jupyter notebook . Jupyter notebook is a kind of online python notebook. If you are new :slightly_smiling_face:	 to jupyter notebook and know nothing about jypyter Notebook .Then don't worry, do not loose hope you can find many online resources which are free and you can learn a lot :raised_hands: about Jupyter notebook form them.

In this project linear regression is used to make the predictions. In Linear regression we draw a line to that best fits the given data. We try to select the line that also  minimises the error.

Linear regression is a very basic techinque in machine learning . But you are free to use :hugs: any other techinique of your choice to make the prediction. If you are interested in it then you can download the dataset from my repository. Best of Luck ! :+1:
:thumbsup:
